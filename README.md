Unity is using NVIDA's Psysx

- Rigidbodies - Non-deforming object that responds to forces, collisions and joints
- Colliders - invisible surface used to calculate collisions
- Physic Materials - Definition of physical properties stored in a modular asset
- Joints(they are called Dynamic constraints in Maya) - constraints behaviour along some axis
- Forces - Energy applied to dynamic objects:
  * Linear
  * Angular (Torque)
- Cloth (special case) Deformable object that reacts to forces & collisions
  * Interactive
  * Skinned

Important: Physics ---> Performance
- Scale ==> 1 Unit = 1 Meter
