Note: GameObjects need to be flagged as Static to be included in the lightmap for ambient lighting. This is because lightmap data is precalculated and can only be calculated for GameObjects that don’t move at runtime. 

Color resources for lighting
Khan Academy’s Pixar in a Box course unit on color science: A foundational primer that will take you deeper into the science of color than this learning experience.

Draw Paint Academy’s Color theory guide for artists: An artist-perspective guided tour through color theory, and a useful refresher for those with a background in visual art.

Massachusetts College of Art and Design’s Color theory research guide: A starting point to help you begin your own research journey into the aspects of color theory that interest you most.

Bill Williams’s Stage Lighting Design on General Design Methods: Although written with a focus on theater lighting design, the basic concepts are still relevant for lighting for 3D digital spaces.

convex vs concave
https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=_uE90sarrrc
the convex is like wrapping, it doesnt have holes
the convex shape it has only one entry point and exit point if you draw a line through it

Fixing the normals after the bridge edge loops. 

Mesh->Normals->Flip
The Book is finished based on the tutorial, but the import into Unity is failed.
I can't see the textures.

Looking at the next video while waiting for the answer:
The Basics of Designing 3D Art with Blender and Unity(O'Reilly) - this was very useful. I created a book model eventually.

A new shortcut: Shift-A to add a new object in the object mode.

Building a book continued.
Select edges and hold the Shift button, press F to fill it up
Ctrl-R for a loop cut, in the Loop and cut menu set number of cuts to 5.
TO make the curvy side of the book, select the very middle edge and enable proportional editing by presssing O from the 
keyboard

Important: change Preferences/Navigation/Orbit & Pan/Orbit Mrethod -> Trackball
G = free Translate/Manipulate (X, Y and Z to lock axis) S = free Scale/Resize (X, Y and Z to lock axis) R = free Rotate (X, Y and Z to lock axis) 

## Selecting multiple edges:
 - Tab => Edit mode
 - Shift + Click  to select multiple edges
 - Ctrl-B to bevel the edges
 - select edges - bridge edge loops - to make faces 
 - select faces - Alt-E to bring the menu - extrude along normals
 - select faces - Shift-H to hide evrything except selected faces, bridge edge loops`
 - Select the loop - Mark seam

Tab - to get into the edit mode
Ctr-R for loop cut

Unity is using NVIDA's Psysx

https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/PhysX/

- Rigidbodies - Non-deforming object that responds to forces, collisions and joints
- Colliders - invisible surface used to calculate collisions
- Physic Materials - Definition of physical properties stored in a modular asset
- Joints(they are called Dynamic constraints in Maya) - constraints behaviour along some axis
- Forces - Energy applied to dynamic objects:
  * Linear
  * Angular (Torque)
- Cloth (special case) Deformable object that reacts to forces & collisions
  * Interactive
  * Skinned

Important: Physics ---> Performance
- Scale ==> 1 Unit = 1 Meter
